### Hey there! 👋

- 🔭  Like any amibitious learner, I float between pet projects. Currently, I'm working on:
> [**NoteNice**](http://twwright.github.io/notenice), a notetaking app that allows you to create, share, and copy publico or private notes. It's written in Ruby using Sinatra backed by a PostgresQL database.

> [**DashDashHelp**](http://twwright.github.io/dashdashhelp), a community-driven web app for asking and answering questions while working through online course curricum. It uses a Rails back-end and ERB templating for the front-end with a touch of Bootstrap. 

> [**FoodExplorer**](http://twwright.github.io/foodexplorer), an obligatory CLI game that uses Spoonacular APIs to display nutritional data for random items. Fun fact: this was my first coding project!

> [**Wod.link**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcXhaampLZQ), a digital gym "whiteboard" for managing a group fitness gym's workouts, athlete performances, and members-only social network. *(Coming soon)*

> [**Cover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAIP6fI0NAI), an entirely customizable cover letter generator --- like madlibs for cover letters. Cover is a single-page application with a Javascript front-end using a back-end Rails API. *(Coming soon)*

- 🌱  I’m currently learning **Ruby on Rails** and **React** at [the Flatiron School](www.flatironschool.com). I also take courses at [CodeSmith](http://codesmith.io) to level up my vanilla **JavaScript** skills. I'm also finishing up Michael Hartl's very, very excellent [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org) as part of his [Learn Enough](https://www.learnenough.com) series. I **highly** recommend it!

- 📖  I oscillate between books. Currently, those books are *Test-Driven Development* by Kent Beck; *Design Patterns* by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides; and *The Complete Cosmicomics* by Italo Calvino. My wife only finds one out of three of these books interesting; bonus points if you can guess which one it is.

- 📝  Sometimes I write about cool stuff or share tips and tricks over on [my blog](http://dev.to/twiddlewakka). I also mentor for the Ruby track on [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io).

- 💬  I have a Masters in Philosophy from the University of Houston. I love talking about [analytic metaphysics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaphysics/#ProMetNewMet), [philosophy of language](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meaning/), and [logical quantification](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ontology/). I've written about and given talks related to [my work](https://independent.academia.edu/TWWright) in fictional objects and ontology.

- 📫  I love getting emails at [twright@hey.com](mailto:twright@hey.com). Feel free to reach out about anything.

- 😄  My pronouns are [he/him/his](https://pronoun.is/he).

- 🏋️  Fun fact: I coach and compete in olympic weightlifting and CrossFit!
