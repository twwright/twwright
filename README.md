### Hey there! 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Workle**, a somewhat simple enterprise app designed specifically for my current company. It's written in Rails and styled with some Bootstrap and minimal JS.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Ruby on Rails** and **ReactJS** at [the Flatiron School](www.flatironschool.com) and [Codesmith](www.codesmith.io).

- 📝 Sometimes I write about cool stuff or share tips and tricks over on [my blog](http://dev.to/twiddlewakka).

- 💬 I have a Masters in Philosophy from the University of Houston. I love talking about [analytic metaphysics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaphysics/#ProMetNewMet), [philosophy of language](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meaning/), and [logical quantification](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ontology/). I've written about and given talks related to [my work](https://independent.academia.edu/TWWright) in fictional objects and ontology.

- 📫 I love getting emails at [twright@hey.com](mailto:twright@hey.com). Feel free to reach out about anything.

- 😄 My pronouns are [he/him/his](https://pronoun.is/he).

- 🏋️ Fun fact: I coach and compete in olympic weightlifting and CrossFit!
